//Standard mathematical operations are available as built-in operations :
declare {
  var a=0, b, d, e, maximum
  val c = sin(b) //Error : all declarations must come before the statements of a scope. (b=90 is an assignment statement)
  b = 90
  e = a d = 1.2
  if ((isFloat(d) && isFloat(e)) || (isInt(d) && isInt(e))) {
    val m
    max(d, e, m)
    //Most built-in functions have a procedure equivalent, where we pass an existing variable as the last argument to store the result.
    // The 2 previous lines are thus equivalent to :
    maximum = max(d, e)
