\paragraph{Abstract}
\textit{
The Oz programming language has proven over the years its value as a learning and research tool \textcolor{red}{about} programming paradigms, in many universities around the world.
It has had a major influence over different more recent programming languages, and has functionally stood the test of time.
That being said, its syntax lacks the ability the efficiently use some modern programming paradigms;
the goal of this work, building upon last year's thesis of Jean-Pacifique Mbonyincungu, is to design a brand new syntax for Oz, that will allow the language to tackle new paradigms, while still being compatible with the existing Mozart system.
