Description:
Oz is a well-factored language that supports many programming paradigms and is successfully being used in courses and MOOCs.
It has also influenced the development of other languages such as Scala and Go.
The internal structure of Oz has stood the test of time.
But the syntax has not: there are many idioms used today that Oz syntax supports poorly.
For example, big-data style computations often use a composition of functional objects, with a syntax something like DB.select_list(f1).map(f2).sort(f3).reduce(f4,u), with a chain of operations such that each operation takes a functional object and returns a new functional object.
Oz syntax does not support this well.

This master's project continues the work of an earlier master's project on improving Oz syntax.
The ultimate goal is to change the Oz syntax in the official release of Mozart 2, which is a major result.
That is why this work is spread over several years, in several master's projects.
The goal is to make a completely new syntax of Oz, taking advantage of the best parts of Scala, Python, Go, Clojure, and other modern languages.
The new syntax should be simple, well-factored, and support sophisticated programming idioms, while still keeping the clean Oz kernel language semantics.
You will study important programming idioms in many languages and design and implement a new parser front end for the Mozart 2 system.
